# Solana Keygen App

This application demonstrates how to:
* Generate and manage Solana keypairs (public/private keys)
* Store keypairs locally and back them up
* Request airdrops on the Solana test network
* Transfer SOL (test tokens) between addresses
* Load existing keypairs from a file

It is intended for development and testing only. This application should not be used in production with real assets on mainnet.

## Features
* Generate New Keypairs: Creates a new Solana keypair on demand
* Local Storage: Saves generated keypairs (public/private) in the browser's localStorage
* Balance Checks: Retrieves and displays each account's balance (in SOL)
* Airdrop: Requests SOL on the specified network (e.g., devnet/testnet) for development testing
* Transfer: Send SOL to any valid Solana address
* Backup/Restore: Export keypairs to a .json file and import them back

## Prerequisites
* Node.js (v14 or later recommended)
* NPM or Yarn
* A Solana cluster for testing, e.g. testnet or devnet

## Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project (same level as package.json), then add the following key:

```
REACT_APP_SOLANA_NETWORK=<network>
```

Where `<network>` can be one of:
* devnet
* testnet
* mainnet-beta (not recommended for testing with real assets)

For example:
```
REACT_APP_SOLANA_NETWORK=testnet
```

**Note:**
1. The `REACT_APP_` prefix is required for create-react-app to automatically load environment variables
2. Do not include private keys in your `.env` file

## Installation & Local Deployment

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solana-keygen.git
cd solana-keygen
```

2. Install Dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

3. Set Environment Variables:
   * Create a file named `.env` in the project root
   * Add `REACT_APP_SOLANA_NETWORK=<network>` to it. Example:
```
REACT_APP_SOLANA_NETWORK=testnet
```

4. Start Development Server:
```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

By default, it will open in http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

Once running locally, open your browser at http://localhost:3000.

### 1. Create New Keypair
* Click Create New Keypair
* A new keypair (public and private key) will appear in the list
* The public key is always displayed. The private key is hidden by default

### 2. Show / Hide Private Key
* Use the Show/Hide toggle to reveal or conceal your private key

### 3. Balance & Airdrop
* Click Refresh Balance to fetch the current balance on the chosen cluster (testnet or devnet)
* To get test SOL, enter the amount (up to 2 SOL in the code) in the input box, then click Fund (Faucet)
* This uses Solana's requestAirdrop() API
* If desired, open the Solana Faucet Website link to manually request funds

### 4. Transfer SOL
* Under Transfer SOL, select the From Address from your generated keypairs
* Enter the To Public Key (any valid Solana address)
* Enter an Amount (SOL)
* Click Transfer to perform the transaction
* A transaction signature will be displayed upon success (or an error if it fails)

### 5. Delete Address
* Click Delete Address to remove it from local storage
* This action is permanent unless you have a backup

## Backup and Restore Keypairs

### 1. Backup Keypairs
* Click Backup Keypairs to download a solana-keypairs.json file
* This JSON file includes public/private keys for all addresses currently in local storage

### 2. Load Keypairs
* Click Load Keypairs and choose a .json file (e.g. the previously downloaded backup)
* The file must contain an array of addresses with publicKey, privateKey, and id fields in the correct format
* Existing keypairs in local storage will remain; new ones from the file will be added if they're not duplicates

> **Warning:** Always keep your private keys in a secure place and never commit them to a public repository!

## Important Notes
* This sample uses the Solana Web3.js library to interact with the blockchain
* The environment variable `REACT_APP_SOLANA_NETWORK` determines which cluster you connect to
* Never use the private keys generated by this project for production or real Mainnet funds
* This project is for development and educational purposes only
